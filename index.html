        <h2>The story</h2>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, 
            <q class="quote--villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
             The farmer said, 
            <q class="quote--farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q> 
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="quote--villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="quote--farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q>
        </p>

The neighbors then said, 
            <q class="quote--villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> 
            and the farmer responded,
            <q class="quote--farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> 
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
            <q class="quote--villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="quote--farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q>
        </p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <data value="good" class="good">good</data> or <data value="bad" class="bad">bad</data> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

                    <td><strong>Maybe</strong></td>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are <data value="good" class="good">good</data> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <data value="good" class="good">good</data> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
